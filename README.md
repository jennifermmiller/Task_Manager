Task_Manager
============

Over the weekend, we were assigned our [first group project](http://gloryofthe80s.github.io/Team_Project/#). The goal: to put everything we've learned so far into use. Recommendation: to create something that vaguely resembled a mini-Twitter-type setup. This project used: HMTL, SASS, Javascript constructors, jQuery, and Underscore. It was also my fisrt experience using github with a group (branches, pull request, merges, etc).


On Moday, we were told to go back and individually recreate our group project overnight. The goal being to reinforce everything we did over the weekend and become more proficient.
