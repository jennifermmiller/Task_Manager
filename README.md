Task_Manager
============

Over the weekend, we were assigned our [first group project](http://gloryofthe80s.github.io/Team_Project/#). The goal: to put everything we've learned so far into use. Recommendation: to create something that vaguely resembles a mini-Twitter-type setup. This project used: HMTL, SASS, Javascript constructors, jQuery, and Underscore. It was also my fisrt experience using github with a group.


On Moday, we were told to recreate our group project overnight.
